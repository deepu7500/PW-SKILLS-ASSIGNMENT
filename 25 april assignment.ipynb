    "* PCA  is a widely used dimensionality reduction technique in data analysis. It aims to transform the original data into a new coordinate system represented by the principal components, which are eigenvectors of the covariance matrix of the data. The eigenvalues associated with these eigenvectors indicate the amount of variance captured by each principal component. By choosing a subset of the principal components with the highest eigenvalues, you can project the data onto a lower-dimensional subspace while preserving as much variance as possible.\n",

The affinity matrix captures pairwise relationships between data points, and by computing its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, you can embed the data points in a lower-dimensional space. Clustering is then performed in this space, often using k-means or other methods. \n",
